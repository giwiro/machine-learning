The main idea of linear regression is to predict some value from input (\textit{x\textsubscript{i}}) using a function that has a linear behaviour. The \textbf{goal} is to find the most accurate coefficients for the linear function we must reduce the error as much as possible, in other words, we gotta minimize the cost function.
